<!--
Q1: The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
Q2: Using an incomplete or outdated DOCTYPE—or no DOCTYPE at all—throws these same browsers into “Quirks” mode, where the browser assumes you've written old-fashioned, invalid markup and code per the depressing industry norms of the late 1990s.

    Travel can be stressful, for a lot of reasons. But some stress can be
    preempted. Whenever you leave the house for more than a few days, you
    should do these things:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Turn off the water to all toilets. You never know what they'll do while
      you're gone.
    </li>
    <li>
      Keep your toothbrush and toothpaste in your carry-on. If your suitcase
      gets lost, your mouth feels it first.
    </li>
    <li>
      Get a dragon sitter. Your pet may seem aloof when you're around, but the
      minute you leave, it will start crying, loudly.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
