<!--
Q1: The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
Q2: Using an incomplete or outdated DOCTYPE—or no DOCTYPE at all—throws these same browsers into “Quirks” mode, where the browser assumes you've written old-fashioned, invalid markup and code per the depressing industry norms of the late 1990s.

            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease or line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Combine the sugar, beaten egg and sour cream together. Mix in the flour, baking soda and salt. Blend thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Divide dough in half and form each half into a long roll. (Note: If your kitchen is warm, keep the half of dough you're not working with in the refrigerator.) Cut off a narrow slice of dough. Roll lightly with hands on lightly floured board into pencil-like strip about 7 inches long. Form into a figure "8", and pinch ends together. Place on cookie sheet. Repeat with remaining dough.</li>
            <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
